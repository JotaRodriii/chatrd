## üõ†Ô∏è Setting it up

Make sure your **Twitch**, **YouTube** and **Kick** accounts are connected on **Streamer.bot**. Also have **TikFinity Desktop App** installed and your account on **TikTok** setup. **BOTH APPS NEED TO RUN ON THE SAME PC**.

If you have both of these ready, follow these steps:

1. On **Streamer.bot**, import the file [chatrd.sb](https://github.com/JotaRodriii/chatrd/blob/main/chatrd.sb) to your **Streamer.bot**.
2. Go to **Server/Clients ‚Üí WebSocket Server** and make sure it is running.
5. Open the [Settings Page](https://JotaRodriii.github.io/chatrd) in your browser.
6. Choose your desired options.
7. Click **"Copy URL"**.
8. Add the copied URL as a Browser Source in OBS. Or use it in your browser to read chat. üòä
9. For **Streamlabs**, **StreamElements**, **Patreon**, **TipeeeStream**, **Ko-Fi** and **Fourthwall**, you need to connect them to your Streamer.Bot account to their website. Follow the tutorial links in each section presented in the [Settings Page](https://JotaRodriii.github.io/chatrd).

## üîä Setting TTS with Speaker.Bot

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí WebSocket Server**, click on *Start Server*. Make sure to also tick the *Auto-Start* checkbox.
2. Copy the IP and Port to ChatRD Speaker.bot fields.
3. Go  to **Settings ‚Üí Speech Engine** and add the TTS Service of your preference. (Sapi5 is the Windows default).
4. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Voice Aliases**, give it a name and click **Add** right next to it.
5. In the Left Column, click on the **SpeakerBot** you just added and on the **Speak!** section, select the voice you want to use and click **Add**. (If you're using Sapi5, I recommend using *Microsoft Zira Desktop* as a voice).

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
**- Can I use it to read my chat?**
R: Yes you can. You can open it on your browser, use it as a chat overlay and/or use it as a dock in OBS.

**- What about YouTube Members Emotes?**
R: YouTube doesn't expose their Membership/Partner Emojis to Streamer.bot. You would have to add them manually on ChatRD's Members Only Emotes section.

What Casterlabs Caffeinated, Social Stream Ninja and Onecomme do to scrape the emotes won't work with the current way Streamer.Bot and my code works, so I had to choose between **making the user add them manually** or build a **server-sided executable (using NodeJS, Python or whatever) to read the chat as it's going or scrape the HTML code**. I don't want to add another executable on top of the user's flow, so it would be easier to use what it's currently available. **And no, I won't do any research based on what other tools do.**

**- Can I set TTS to read only the events I want to read?**
R: No. ChatRD sends either chats, events or both to Speaker.bot.

**- TikTok events are not working anymore, what should I do?**
R: Make sure your TikFinity is connected to your account and you are live.

**- Kick events are not working or are taking too much time to show, what should I do?**
R: Kick's API is notoriously slow on their peak usage. It's been reported on [Streamer.bot](https://discord.streamer.bot/) Discord (check html-css-js section) that sometimes it could take up to 60 seconds for the responses to be relayed. I hope in the future they throw more money into their servers.

**- Can you add other streaming/payment platforms?**
R: ChatRD uses Streamer.Bot to 95% of all platform iterations. *TikFinity* is perfectly integrated via WebSockets. So if the platform has any integration with Streamer.bot or has a decent WebSocket API (not WebHooks), feel free to suggest it. Other than that, there are no plans to add more platforms.

**- Can I customize it?**
R: If you mean visual styles, you can add your own using the *Custom CSS* field in OBS's Browser Source Properties Window. You can use your browser Dev Tools to inspect the elements you want to change. **I won't provide support if you're planning to customize codes that could break ChatRD**.
